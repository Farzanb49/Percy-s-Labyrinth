PROJECT TITLE:Percy's Labyrinth
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: GUI - Criteria C - ICS208 Final Project
VERSION or DATE:June 7, 2019
AUTHORS:Farzan Bhuiyan

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Run the project through the StartingFile class to start the game
USER INSTRUCTIONS:To play the game, you have two gamemodes: the first gamemode consists of three pre made mazes of varying difficulty (level 1, 2, and 3) Click the "Level" button in the main menu and the combo box in the following screen that appears and select one of the levels to play them. There are level 4, 5, and 6 options but those are your own mazes. Unless you have edited them, an unplayable maze will appear. So select either maze 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being the easiest level and 3 being the hardest. You can play the maze you selected by going back to the main menu screen and clicking the "Play" button. 

The second gamemode allows you to make your own maze. Click "MazeMaker" button on the main menu screen, which shows you a small screen where you can select what maze you want to edit (either level 4, 5, or 6). Select one and you will be brought to a screen with a grid on it. Left click to turn a tile from gray to white, which creates a path (the icon moving through the maze can pass through that tile), and right click to turn a tile from white to gray. Gray tiles are walls that a character cannot move through. Close the screen and the maze automatically saves. Go back to the main menu and click the "Level" button and select the level you just edited in the combo box. Go back and click "Play" in the main menu to play the game.

Have fun!
